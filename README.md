## Welcome to MUMIE Task
This plugin allows teachers to add exercises from the e-learning Platform                      
[MUMIE](https://www.integral-learning.de/) as activity modules in their Moodle courses. MUMIE 
Task is not meant to be used as a standalone but in combination with                            
[MUMIE Single Sign On](https://github.com/integral-learning/moodle-auth_mumie/). Together, 
these two plugins allow the integration of MUMIE content into your Moodle courses.

## What is MUMIE?
**Explorative Math Learning**

MUMIE is an e-learning platform for learning and teaching mathematics and computer science. It 
grew out of the needs of practical teaching at the interface between high school and university. 
MUMIE is highly flexible and can be integrated with other learning and content management 
systems. Its courses and high-quality course material is easily adjusted to any kind of  
pedagogical scenario. It has built-in learning and training environments with wiki-like  
dedicated social networks for virtual tutorials and self-organized learning enhancing cognitive 
and meta-cognitive skills. Powerful authoring tools support the production of new content. This  
opens the door to new, challenging and more efficient pedagogical scenarios.
